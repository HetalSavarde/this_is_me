## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- Building full-stack applications using **Node.js, Java, and Next.js**
- Backend system design, RESTful APIs, and database integration
- Learning **Machine Learning fundamentals** using Python
- Exploring how ML models and LLMs can be integrated into real-world products

---

## 🧠 Core Interests
- Building and understanding **machine learning models**
- Learning Python libraries used in ML (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn – in progress)
- Exploring **LLMs and AI systems**, including model behavior, data flow, and inference
- Understanding how **AI and ML work together** in production-grade applications
- Applying ML concepts to real-world platforms and web applications
